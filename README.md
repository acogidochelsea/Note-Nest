# 🪺 Note Nest

A centralized platform for students to upload, share, and browse class notes across courses and year levels — built to make collaboration easier, faster, and more accessible.

## 📌 Overview

Students often share notes informally through AirDrop, private group chats, or personal file-sharing links. These systems are inefficient, inaccessible, and often limited to small groups like blockmates or orgmates.

**Note Nest** aims to solve this by creating a centralized and organized note-sharing platform. With Note Nest, students can easily browse and upload notes in a system that mirrors the familiarity of social media — simple, fast, and community-driven.
